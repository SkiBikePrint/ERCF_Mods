- The fixing method of the front wheel has been changed from press fit to bolt method for disassembly/assembly.
Improved convenience

- Easy to attach and detach from one 2020 profile (Small parts that can be placed on a flat surface will be added later)
  
- Designed part size so that it can be printed on a 180x180 size bed.

- Hole on the front to check the condition of the O-ring

- Can be replaced with wider wheels to accommodate wider spools (Wheels of various widths, fixed and released with 2 bolts)
