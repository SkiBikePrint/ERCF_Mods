# ERCF_Mods
These files are for a 2020 extrusion based ERCF top mounting that integrates into a set of handles for a Voron Trident or V2.  It includes a roller based spool feed system as well as a 3 slot 1000mm buffer design.

This variant fixes some badly mangled non-watertight geometry.

Other changes are use of m10 ECAS passthrough fittings, 6x2.5 magents and only 3M screw support.

Fusion files are attached, as well as STEP for those that want to modify back to press-in connectors.  Modify the threaded screw step to match your geometry.
