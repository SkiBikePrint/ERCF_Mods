This allows for purging with blobs and using the hot end silicone jacket to knock the blobs off into a bin.  This is a solution for using Blobifier on a Trident.


I am loading/unloading my ERCF at 400/500 speed/accel (so pretty fast).  To be successful with that I want a pretty straight bowden run and this is why I chose to locate my Filametrix and purge site up front.  This sacrifices the first ~100mm of build area at the font of the plate.  If you place yours in the rear you don't give up build space.  You will be limited to a max height of around 150mm. Taller than this and the part will hit the top of the enclosure when the plate returns to Z0 for blob formation.
