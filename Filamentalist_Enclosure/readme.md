BOM:

- 2020 Extrusion - Qty 6 - Select/cut length to be greater than or equal to [Rewinder Qty] X [Rewinder Width] + 10mm
    - for example: 6 X 81.5 (std. Filamentalist Width) + 10 = 499mm.  Round up to a standard 500mm long 2020 extrusion
    - get extrusions with holes that can be tapped to a 5mm thread (like the Misumi with a 4.2mm D hole)
    - examples: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DYMCBYF, https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801651139612.html

- Polycarbonate Sheet (Lexan) - 1/16" (or 0.060") thick.  Width of pieces = Extrusion Length -2mm (i.e. cut sheet to 498mm wide if using 500mm extrusions)
    - Lid Length = 451.5mm
    - Base Rear Panel Height = 120mm
    - Base Front Panel Height = 45mm
    - Bottom Panel Length (if used) = 230mm
    - For enclosures up to 607.6mm wide a single 24" x 36" sheet is enough material.  (2) 24" x 24" or (1) 24" x 24" + (2) 12" x 24" sheets will work as well if it is easier for you to source smaller sheets.

- Seal Material - ~10m or 32ft of 3/8" wide x 1/4" high (9mm x 6mm) self-adhesive weather seal.  Something like this:  https://www.homedepot.com/p/M-D-Building-Products-17-ft-Black-Small-Rubber-Auto-Marine-Weatherseal-for-All-Climates-01025/202066509, or https://www.amazon.com/Insulation-Weatherproof-Soundproofing-Self-Adhesive-Weatherstrip/dp/B082HDZ1P1?th=1, or https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806396445681.html.  Most of the glue needs to be peeled off so you want the style that has the "strings" embedded in the glue to aid in removal.

- M5x10/12mm length BHCS or SHCS - Qty 6 - For securing endc caps to extrusions.  BHCS (Button Head) looks the best.

- M5 10mm length BHCS - Qty 4 - for mounting hinges to base and lid frames

- M5 x 16/18/20mm length BHCS - Qty 2 - Hinge Pin Screws.

- M3 x 4/5mm length BHCS or SHCS - Qty 2 - for tying lid panel to lid endcaps.

- 5mm Heatset Insert - Qty 2 - Optional, for setting how far the lid hinges back.

- M5 x 8/10mm length SHCS - Qty 2 - Optional, for setting how far the lid hinges back.
