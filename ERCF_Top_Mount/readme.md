This is a This is 2020 extrusion based top mount for the ERCF (Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder Multi-material unit developed by ette and the Voron community) 
on Voron 2.x and Trident printers.  The solution includes standalone end mounts adapted from NikosSprocket 
(https://www.printables.com/model/301808-ercf-frame-legs-for-voron-24-300mm) and 2020 mounts integrated into the "Sturdy Handle" adapted from synthden. 

Assembly tip:  The handles are designed to roll into the 2020 extrusion slots.  Because of this roll-in design, following the installation of the first 
handle the extrusions must be inserted to the full depth of the extrusion pockets to create enough space to roll in the opposing handle.  Once the second 
handle is installed the extrusions can be then be slid back out from the first handle pocket and into the second handle pockets.  Now the extrusions are 
fully captured and can not come out without the removal of one (or both) handles.
